# Solana Token Trading Mini-App

This is a Telegram mini-app designed to facilitate trading of Solana-based tokens. It provides users with a seamless and intuitive interface to trade tokens directly from Telegram. The mini-app is part of a broader project that also includes a trading bot, which performs similar trading actions automatically.

## Features

- Trade Solana-based tokens via Telegram
- Simple, user-friendly interface
- Built for quick, efficient transactions on the Solana blockchain

## Bot Integration

In addition to this mini-app, we have developed a bot that automates token trading. You can find the bot repository here:

## How It Works

1. **Mini-App**: Allows users to manually trade Solana-based tokens through the Telegram interface.
2. **Bot**: Automates trading actions, operating in sync with the mini-app, for enhanced trading efficiency.
